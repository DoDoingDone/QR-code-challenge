# QR-code-challenge
QR code challenge from Frontend Mentor  

This is my first code challenge.  I am <em>very</em> new to coding.
I have a few months of HTML and CSS classes, but really need the 
hands-on practice.  Any pointers for a newbie on semantic HTML, writing
clean code or CSS would be most appreciated.
