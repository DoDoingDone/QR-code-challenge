## My process 
Mostly, just trying to lay out a clean bit of code using HTML and CSS.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I need a lot more practice to get up to speed!  And as a complete newbie, I worry too much.  I just need to write code daily and be willing to make mistakes to learn.

### Continued development

I want to get a solid grasp of semantic HTML, as well as css, flexbox and grid basics. (I love the magic that is css!) After that, my goals are advanced css, Sass, and javascript. Any suggestions are welcome!

Shoutout to @correlucas on Frontend Mentor.  Once I got stuck, having too much code for a little project, his advice on another person's code gave me the pointers I needed to trim mine down a bit.
