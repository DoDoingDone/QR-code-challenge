## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process 
Mostly, just trying to lay out a clean bit of code using HTML and CSS.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I need a lot more practice to get up to speed!  And as a complete newbie, I worry too much.  I just need to write code daily and be willing to make mistakes to learn.

### Continued development

I want to get a solid grasp of semantic HTML, as well as css, flexbox and grid basics. (I love the magic that is css!) After that, my goals are advanced css, Sass, and javascript. Any suggestions are welcome!

Shoutout to @correlucas on Frontend Mentor.  Once I got stuck, having too much code for a little project, his advice on another person's code gave me the pointers I needed to trim mine down a bit.
